# Cooking Notes

#### Cast Iron
- Avoid simmering acidic liquids.
- Best seasoning oil is **flaxseed**; but **canola** works as well (and is less expensive).
- Clean cast irons while still warm - with salt and rough side of sponge. Once dry, cover with oil and heat to the smoking point (in oven for an hour).
• **Does NOT heat evenly** (must give it time) - but they hold heat really well and have high emissivity (meaning not just the food in contact with the pan will cook). 
- Washing cast iron with soap won’t remove the polymerized oil - just don’t let it soak. 
- **Using metal utensils is fine** since the seasoning is chemically bonded to the pan and won't easily scrape away.
- **Enameled:**
  - Won't rust.
  - Food may stick.
  - Simmering acids won't strip seasoning.
  - Usually more expensive.
  - Usually less durable.
  - High heat may compromise the enamel.
  - Doesn't require seasoning.

#### Things to Remember

- Pat the steak/burger dry before seasoning (or leave in fridge uncovered overnight to dry the surface). 
- Burgers should be made with **chuck steak (shoulder)** (80/20 fat ratio).
- **Easy chicken sauce**: deglaze pan with stock, reduce, add garlic, thyme, butter. 
- Non-stick pans are meant for lower heat cooking of more delicate foods. 
- For juicier chicken breast, brine in warm salt water for 15 mins. 
- Nearly all the bitterness and soapy flavor in quinoa can be eliminated simply by rinsing off the natural coating, saponin, before cooking.
- Cook bacon starting in a cold pan; fat has more time to render leaving crispier, less greasy bacon. 
- Score the tail of fish and fold under to even out the thickness and thus the cooking. 
- **Velveting** = using baking soda to tenderize cheap meat.
- **Tempering** = slowly combining ingredients that are opposite temperatures. 
- **Emulsion** = the process of integrating two fluids that generally don't mix. 
- Use a **wooden spoon to stir sauces**; metal may flavour them.
- **Never rinse pasta** or beans as it will remove the starch necessary for holding sauces.
- Flour shouldn't be added at the end of the cooking process - it needs time to cook. 
- Putting hot soup in the fridge will spoil it.
