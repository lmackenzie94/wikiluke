# Photography Notes

#### Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II

- Cameras naturally tone down bright areas. If whites appear off colour, check the histogram and manually increase the exposure.

- Use "Live Composite" mode for star trails, fire works, light drawings, etc. Set the camera to Manual and dial the shutter speed down to "LIVECOMP". Press the Menu button to set exposure time. 

- Tilt the display screen when taking shots from awkward angles.

- High **ISO** (i.e. noisier, grainy) can be used for artistic effect, especially in black and white.

- Take landscapes with small aperture (high value) for larger depth of field. 

- Set Dial to "ART" to utilize built in filters (ex. Partial Colour mode)

- Use one of the six Bracketing settings to take multiple pictures each with different settings.

- **FAST AF System** = Frequency Accelerated Sensor Technology. - Press "Info" during AF Target Selection to choose all targets, single target, small target, or group target.
    - The smiley face icon means "Face Priority". If there's an "I" next to it, Face and Eye Priority is on. Choose iR or iL to select the pupil of the eye on the right or left. 
    - **S-AF** Mode (in Menu) is Single Auto Focus: camera focuses when the shutter is pressed half way and locks until picture is taken. 
    - **C-AF** Mode is Continuous Auto Focus: camera continues to focus subject until shutter is released. Should be used for moving subjects.
    - **MF** is Manual Focus.
    - Note: you can use the touch screen to focus instead of the shutter button.

- Image Stabilization is best for macro, low-light, and video (which are more prone to camera shake). 
    - S-IS Auto: camera automatically detects camera movement and sets IS accordingly. 
    - S-IS 1: stabilizer functions across all 5 axes.
    - S-IS 2: vertical stabilization for panning.
    - S-IS 3: horizontal stabilization for holding camera vertically and panning.
    - M-IS 1 and 2: are for movies. 

- **EVF** = Electronic View Finder.

- **HDR (High Dynamic Range)** takes multiple photos at different exposures to create one high-contrast image. 

- Tap the Wifi icon on the display screen to connect.
